h1. Clutch

Clutch is a "Clojure":http://clojure.org library for "Apache CouchDB":http://couchdb.apache.org/. Although it's in an early stage of development (Clutch API subject to change), Clutch supports most of the basic Apache CouchDB APIs. To get a sense of where we are at with Clutch, please view "the tests.":http://github.com/ashafa/clutch/blob/master/test/test_clutch.clj 
<br /><br /><br />

<pre>
  (ns #^{:author "Tunde Ashafa"}
      clutch-example
      (:use com.ashafa.clutch))

  (def example-database
    (get-database {:name     "clutch_test_db"
                   :language "clojure"}))     ; use Clutch (Clojure) view server

  (with-db example-database
           ;; insert or update multiple documents
           (bulk-update [{:test-grade 10}
                         {:test-grade 20}
                         {:test-grade 30}])
           ;; create temporary or permanent views using clojure 
           (ad-hoc-view
             (with-clj-view-server
                {:map    (fn [doc] [[nil (:test-grade doc)]])
                 :reduce (fn [keys values _] (apply + values))}))) ; => 60
</pre>

h3. Download and Installation

Clutch uses Leiningen. For installation and help on using Leiningen visit the "github repo":http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/ .

To include Clutch in your project, simply add the following to your project.clj:

<pre>(:dependencies [com.ashafa/clutch "0.2.2"])</pre>

and run...

<pre>lein deps</pre>

h3. Configuring your CouchDB installation to use the Clutch view server

To use Clojure for views and filters, add the following to the 'local.ini' file of your CouchDB installation (replacing &lt;path to...&gt; with the appropiate paths to the jars which reside in the "lib" folder in your project folder).

<pre>
  [query_servers]
  clojure = java -cp <path to clojure.jar>/clojure.jar:<path to clojure-contrib.jar>/clojure-contrib.jar:clutch.jar com.ashafa.clutch.view_server
</pre>
