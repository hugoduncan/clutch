    :doc "This is a spike of a couchapp-compatible design document sync tool
          built on clutch. The objectives here are much less ambitious and
          not necessarily the same as couchapp's.

          Specifically, these utilities only support pushing and cloning
          design documents as a way of initializing databases and views as
          required by applications using a couchdb instance as a data source.
          i.e. enabling clojure webapps to carry view definitions and
          prep a couch for use itself automagically rather than having a separate
          db configuration/preparation stage prior to app deployment.

          Some notes:

          * only _id, language, and views slots are copied in either direction
          * clone-all and push-all are available for operating over all design
            documents in a database/directory; the former will create the target
            database if necessary."}
